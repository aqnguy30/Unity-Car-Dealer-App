# unity-car-project
This project was built basing on Unity application. In this app, users can interact with augmented object.
For now, it is just a prototype.

 --------------------------
 Background
 ----------------------------
 There are many vendors who sell used cars in the USA. Unlike large car vendors, small car vendors lack competition and budget for customer services. Most small car vendors in Houston use Craiglist to introduce their commodities. There are always big issues between used car sellers and customers: different languages, different cultures, customers who do not understand features of the cars. Therefore, this project will help improve business of small car vendors in Houston, Texas as small scale. It can be improved to larger scale if there is big investment and interest.
 
 ----------------------------------------
Thinking Processs
 ---------------------------------------
We inteviewed some local car vendors to know their issues in business.
 When we first tried to build the app by using only Xcode, ARKIT, and swift language, I came across issues: 
       -The complication of building AR object from scratch in ARKIT and xcode
       -the requirements of technology: to run the AR application, there is a need of Iphone 6s at least
 After so many failures, we switched to using Unity to build an AR object in console of Unity
 
 
 ----------------------------------------
Usage
----------------------------------------------
Download the repos and run the project on Xcode. From xcode, you can install the app on iphones that allows AR application. 

-----------------------------------
Notes
---------------------------------------
We could try to upload the Unity version that we built, but Github could not contain such a massive size, and it keeps crashing. This is the Xcode version which was converted from the Unity version.
